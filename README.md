The DAO pattern in Java, particularly in regard to JPA, keeps the database interaction logic away from business logic. It gives a clean API to your data operations using DAOs and hence modularizes your code, making it easier to maintain. A DAO interface defines methods for CRUD operations on your entities. Implementation of this interface uses JPA's EntityManager to interact with the database. Consequently, this setup keeps complexities of database operations abstracted away from business logic, which is concerned about core functionality of the application. For example, the StudentDAO interface would contain methods such as addStudent, getStudent, deleteStudent, and so on, whose implementation will use JPA to persist Student entities in a database. This change will make the application more flexible and easier to test since the data access layer can be changed without affecting the business logic.
